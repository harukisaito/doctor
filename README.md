# Doctor

My first 2D platformer in Unity. The Concept was a doctor fighting against diseases but it quickly turned into a regular 2D platformer with nothing special. The Player is now a bird? fighting against virus-like creatures. 

I did all of the 
* animations
* background designs
* programming
* etc

but I didnt make the sounds and music myself.
